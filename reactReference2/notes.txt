----> USESTATE
useState will help to re-render the component 

when there is a change in the useState variable React idetifies that changes and re-renders that component.

Whereas React will not identify when there is a change in the normal varilable, hence even though normal variable value gets changed logically it will not get updated in the DOM.


----> USEEFFECT

useEffect will get triggered after component is rendered

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on every render
});

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs only on the first render
}, []);


useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);
